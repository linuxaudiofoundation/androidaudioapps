Getting Started with MICHI Remote Control

Before running the app on your Android smartphone/tablet (version 10 or greater) your preamp must be:

    powered on
    connected to your network with wire Ethernet cable to your router and reachable on local network
    your phone must have the WIFI activated and be part of your local network (like your preamp)

The app will discover automatically your pre-amp only if the device is reachable on your local/Home network. If your HIFI device is not found, check your configuration and restart app to re-scan or enter the IP address and port manually (port should be 9590 for ROTEL or 9596 for MICHI).
